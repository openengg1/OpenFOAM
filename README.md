Surface film modeling
This repository has different commonly used surface film models used in 3D-CFD. The main goal to create the content is to provide open access to the 3D code development for any CFD professional who wants to develop or utilize the existing models.
Following models have been implemented and validated:
1. Bai-Gosman (1997)
2. Stanton-Rutland (1998)
3. O'Rourke-Amsden (2000)
The files are arranged based on the models. Comments to the equations and variable have been added as and when required.
